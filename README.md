# Tweeter Sentiment Analysis
## This project examines whether tweets coming from Iphones are more positive compared to tweets from Androids. The Android and iPhone tweets are clearly from different people. Tweets from these two devices are posted during different times of day, and the use of hashtags, links, and retweets are distinctive. What’s more, we can see that the Android tweets are angrier and more negative, while the iPhone tweets tend to be benign announcements and pictures.
